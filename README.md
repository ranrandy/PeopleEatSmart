# PeopleEatSmart
CS 411 Project 1, Summer 2021

This project is a website which allows people to first choose from nutrition goals, then get ingredients and recipes which fit their goals. Additionally, people can also sign up to be users of the website. Thus, they can enter their personal info then get more personalized search results. Also, users can help improve the website by rating existing recipes and creating new recipes.

Backend is supported GCP (Google Cloud Platform).

Group Members: Andrew Yin, Runfeng Li, Zhiyuan Yang, Robert Nagel
